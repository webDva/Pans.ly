# Pans.ly
Just a small, little URL shortener web app project (still in early development!)

# How it works
Node.js and Expressjs are used to create the backend API server. The API is designed to be very simple: GET requests for finding where a shortened URL leads to and POST requests to create a new URL PostgreSQL database entry.

The frontend uses Angular to perform some input validation, but ultimately it's up to the API to decide.
